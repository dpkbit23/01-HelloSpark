This is the central repository for all the materials related to Apache Spark  - Spark Programming in Python for data engineers


**Description**
I am creating Apache Spark 3 - Spark Programming in Python for data engineers repository to help you understand the Spark programming and apply that knowledge to build data engineering solutions. This course is example-driven and follows a working session like approach. We will be taking a live coding approach and explain all the needed concepts along the way.


**Spark and source code version**
This Course is using the Apache Spark 3.x. I have tested all the source code and examples used in this Course on Apache Spark 3.0.0 open-source distribution.
